# Classification in Machine Learning using Iris flower Dataset

Introduction:
This project applies machine learning classification algorithms to predict flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The goal of this project is to classify flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using a supervised learning approach.

Dataset:
1. Its a tabular dataset
2. The dataset contains features such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width, and its trageted attribute Species
3. Preprocessing techniques are applied to the dataset to ensure optimal model performance.

Project overview:
1. Data Loading: Load iris flower dataset for training, validation, and testing.
2. Data Preprocessing: included feature selection, target handling, train–test splitting, feature scaling, and exploratory data visualization.
3. Model Building and training: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier using Jupyter Notebook to classify the iris flower. Feature scaling was applied where required. These models were trained and tested on the processed dataset to learn the relationship between flower features and species.
4. Data Visualization (EDA) : Pair plots, Scatter Plots, Box Plots, Correlation heatmaps, Confusion matrix were used to identify feature relationships and data distribution.
5. Prediction: The trained models can predict IRIS flower species (Setosa/Versicolor/Virginica) from new user-provided measurements.
